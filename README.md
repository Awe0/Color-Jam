# Color Jam! 🧩

A **fun and challenging** grid-based puzzle game where players strategically place colored pieces on a 10x10 grid. As the game progresses, some cells become blocked, making it harder to fit the pieces.

## 🎮 Game Features:
- **Randomly Blocked Cells**: Every time the grid resets, random cells become unavailable, adding a layer of complexity to the puzzle.
- **Piece Rotation**: Rotate pieces to fit them into tight spaces and optimize your strategy.
- **Score System**: Earn points by successfully placing pieces and try to beat your personal high score!
- **Dynamic Grid Reset**: When the grid fills up, it resets with new randomly blocked cells, increasing the challenge each round.

## 📜 How to Play:
1. **Place Pieces**: Place colored pieces by clicking on empty cells within the grid.
2. **Rotate**: Use the rotate button to switch the orientation of the piece and fit it into the grid.
3. **Scoring**: Each placed piece earns you points. Keep playing and accumulate the highest score possible.
4. **Grid Reset**: When the grid is completely filled, it resets with new blocked cells, making the game progressively harder.
